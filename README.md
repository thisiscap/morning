# Morning Update

A webpage I check each morning that allows me to check a few things. It uses the following public APIs.

**The plan**

It will tell me the following:
- A different word each day to describe the day
- What day of the week it is
- The temperature outside
- What the weather will be in 1 hour ahead of the current time
- What strength, direction and mph the wind is
- A different joke each day

**Design thoughts**

- Typographic
- Don't use webfonts
- Background and text colour reflect the time of day?

**Things to make**

- [ ] Favicon (.ico)
- [x] Manifest (.json)
- [ ] Icon @ 16, 32, 96px (.png)
- [ ] App icon @ 192px (.png)
